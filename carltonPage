    <p>This is the Carlton walk Bridge.<br>Image taken on 09/22/23</p>
    <p>The top part of the bridge is estimated to be about 22 meters. At the time of this picture, depths on the north side of the bridge were +10ft. Definatly dodsable, probably ok to land on feet. There is a video on youtube from many years ago of a guy trying a gainer off the south side of the bridge from the top. His landing wasnt very good so he probably didnt go down very far which is why I am unsure about how safe it really is for a straight feet landing. Me and my group only dod  </p>

    <p>ALLWAYS TEST RETEST DEPTHS EVERYTIME BEFORE YOU JUMP<br>On 09/22/23 we tested the north side of the bridge for jumping. On that day it was around +10 or +12 ft. This area is the green area on the picture &lpar; NOT EXACT &rpar;.<br>The yellow area is about where one guy landed when he attempted a gainer. We did not test that side so I have no information of depths or structure.</p>

    <p>YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT<br>Just because you cant see it doesnt mean its deep enough to where you wont hit it. Right after the submerged ledge the depths are about +10ft. So once you clear it there should be nothing to worry about.</p>
